# leeto-security
A Java app that manages, creates, and checks secure passwords for elderly people

## What does this app do?
This java app was designed to help the elderly be more secure on their computers. Using Leeto Security, you can be sure that your passwords are secure and managed safely

## How does this work?
This app works by creating string keys that are stored on data files. These keys are refered to and used to hash into secure passwords. These passwords can then be copied and used in your favourite apps. Since we use string keys to store our data, we don't actually store any passwords on your computer that can be stolen.
